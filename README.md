## Working

![Music Reactive LED Block Diagram](https://github.com/jonathanrjpereira/Music-Reactive-Lights/blob/master/img/BD.png)

The input of a Microphone is filtered through a Low Pass Filter. The filter will only allow certain frequencies at the output. The LEDs will only react to these filtered frequencies.

**Low Pass Filter:**

A Low Pass Filter (LPF) will block all signals that are above it's Cutoff Frequency and allow only those signals that are below it's Cutoff Frequency.

The Cutoff Frequency can be set by selecting the passive components as follows: ![LPF](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f_%7Bc%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Cpi%20RC%7D)

## Circuit

![Music Controlled Reactive LED Circuit Schematic](https://github.com/jonathanrjpereira/Music-Reactive-Lights/blob/master/img/sch.png)

The Electret Condenser Microphone has a frequency range between 100-10,000 Hz. The 10KŒ© potentiometer can be varied to change the Cutoff Frequency of the Low Pass Filter.
For example, if the pot is set to 10KŒ©, the Cutoff Frequency will be equal to 159Hz. Similarly if the pot is set to 100Œ© the Cutoff Frequency will be equal to 15KHz.
The transistor BC547 acts as a switch which turns the LEDs ON.
